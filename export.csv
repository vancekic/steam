Master your strategy by researching new cards, scouting your enemies, and outwitting your opponents.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/970370/extras/Img1.png?t=1580279384"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">GAMEPLAY</h2>When you play cards on the galaxy map, they transform into 3D models of ships or structures that you can move around from planet to planet. Turns happen simultaneously, so you will need to anticipate, bluff, and out-think your opponent during each turn if you want to win. Your strategy relies on the deck you build and your choice of technology options selected before you play. During the game, you can modify your strategy by adding powerful, new cards to your deck from your tech-pool.  Explore worlds, colonize sectors, and gain resources to expand your galactic empire and conquer your enemies.","Four billion years in the future, Earth is a distant memory devoured by the same sun that once gave it life. The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are in the middle of a cosmic collision triggering a battle for dominance and survival between alien

Players can conquer territories to unite the land and fly their colors more elaborately and more freely.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New strategies created by supply lines and maintaining the front line</h2>When troops are on the march, and the march origin city is connected to land controlled by the players’ forces, the supply lines will be maintained and troops can battle with ample supplies provided to them. <br>However, if the connection with the march origin city is cut, the troops will lose their supply lines and will be weakened and fall into a disorderly state. Securing the supply lines is an integral part in maintaining the battle front.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Administration changes completely by doctrine and a unique policy!</h2>Players can organize the administration, the center of power, as an element that expands the player's strategy. Administration is shown in an organization chart, and as retained officers are added to the organization, various commands and effects are obtained. It is important to make administration that suits your own strategy.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">More than 150 “characters” and over 1,000 officers – the most in the series!</h2><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/872410/extras/1v1_2.gif?t=1580491221"" ><br>More than 1,000 unique officers, which is the largest in the series, are in the game, and each officer is given a “character” (trait). There are more than 150 characters, with some being useful in battle, some in administration and so on. Some officers possess a powerful and unique character, and arranging the right officer in the right place will help in shortening the path to conquering territories.","Triumph over the land, take charge of the fate of China!

game,Strategic Command: World War I,1096930,0,false,"Strategic Command is back, and this time it is bringing you the Great War! Relive this momentous conflict from the opening shots of 1914 to the final offensives. From the bloody fields of Flanders to the sweeping advances in the east, the fighting in Italy, the Balkans and the Middle East, Strategic Command: World War I covers all the main aspects and theatres of the war.<br />
<br />
Undermine the enemy’s will to resist through diplomacy and political intrigue while mobilizing your forces and developing new technologies and ways of waging war. From the Tank to the Aeroplane, the Submarine to the Aircraft Carrier, this war witnessed a massive outpouring of new weapons, and all of these are at your disposal to research and deploy.<br />
<br />
Using the same upgraded engine as their recent hex-based WWII Grand Strategy games, Strategic Command: World War I allows you to enjoy the challenges faced by commanders on both sides of the 20th century’s first great conflict.<br />
<br />
From the High Seas Fleet to Lawrence of Arabia, the Russian Revolution and the Zimmermann Telegram, the war will be won through strategic ingenuity as well as force. Can a German invasion of France capture Paris in a sweeping advance via Belgium? Can a naval blockade defeat the Central Powers? Will Russia succumb to revolution? All these questions and many more are yours to answer.<br />
<br />
France, Italy, Russia, Serbia, the UK and the USA will be facing off against Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire in our flagship campaign. Many other countries will likely enter the war on either side, such as Belgium, Greece, Portugal and Romania. Not forgetting of course the immense contribution of the British Empire to the Entente’s war effort.<br />

New unit types have been added including ANZACs, Colonial Corps and Mountain Corps.<br />

Kindly note that our game is a comic and humorous parody, thus the majority of events in the game are imaginary. The key story of the game is based on the fact that you are a spy from the USA. You have the following goal: Incite a revolution in Russia. To reach your goal, you have to pay a lot of money to officials and lawmakers just to make them doing those silly and unacceptable things, which they like to do once in a while even without money.

Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.<br><br>Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. </i></strong><br><br><i>Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.<br><br>Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. <br><br>The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise.<br><br>Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh…<br><br>Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.</i>","Strategy gaming perfected. A breath-taking campaign of exploration, expansion and conquest across a fantasy world. Turn-based civilisation management and real-time epic strategy battles with thousands of troops and monsters at your command.","English<strong>*</strong>, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Czech, Korean, Polish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Turkish, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese<br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support",https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/594570/header.jpg?t=1580144883,null,"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 64Bit<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel® Core™ 2 Duo 3.0Ghz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 5 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GTX 460 1GB | AMD Radeon HD 5770 1GB | Intel HD4000 @720p<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 60 GB available space</li></ul>","{""minimum"":""<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\""bb_ul\""><li><strong>OS:</strong> macOS 10.14<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.0GHz Intel Core i5 or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 2GB Nvidia 680MX, 2GB AMD R9 M290, 1.5GB Intel Iris Graphics 540 or better (see notes for more details)<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 51 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The game is officially supported on the following Macs.

New experience.</strong><br>Panzer Corps Wehrmacht is the award-winning turn-based strategy game that the press has called “…nothing short of brilliant” and “the spiritual successor to the Panzer General series”, with high rankings and praise around the world. Brought to fruition by a team of experts and a community of hundreds of fans, Panzer Corps - Wehrmacht has evolved into the ultimate strategy classic that will find a home on any wargamer’s shelf! <br><br>Set in World War II, Panzer Corps - Wehrmacht puts players in the general’s tent in charge of the Axis armies, across 26 scenarios in one large campaign tree, carrying core forces through the war. This core force can gain experience and upgrade to new weaponry as it becomes available. With over 800 unit types, divided into 20 unit classes there is a huge amount to explore. Make use of your unit’s strengths and your enemy’s weaknesses and seize victory. <br><br>Looking for a more ‘human’ challenge? Panzer Corps’ multiplayer is deservedly popular, with thousands of games running on the server at any given time. Find an opponent online quickly and easily throughout the world with Slitherine’s award-winning PBEM++ asynchronous multiplayer system. Play historical battles or balanced scenarios created specifically for multiplayer, where both sides have equal chances to win.
